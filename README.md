The idea of the game is simple, you have to choose as much as possible small numbers as the Total SUM of the numbers would be equal to the Monster Heads shown at the screen.

You have 5 options to reload the monsters, by clicking the reload button at the top right corner.

If the answer is correct you get 5 points for each selected number and if the answer is wrong you lose 1 point.
If you successed to select all numbers and finish the game correctly than you get 50 more points.
